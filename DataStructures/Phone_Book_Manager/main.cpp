 Task. In this task your goal is to implement a simple phone book manager. It should be able to process
 the following types of user's queries:
  
 add number name. It means that the user adds a person with name name and phone number
 number to the phone book. If there exists a user with such number already, then your manager
 has to overwrite the corresponding name.
  
 del number. It means that the manager should erase a person with number number from the
 phone book. If there is no such person, then it should just ignore the query.
  find number. It means that the user looks for a person with phone number number. The manager
 should reply with the appropriate name, or with string \not found" (without quotes) if there is
 no such person in the book.
 
 Use open addressing to build the data structure which will perform abover operations in O(1) time.
